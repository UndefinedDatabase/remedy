# Live Review — F105 Cache-optimal prompt ordering

## Findings

- R-0221 (Low, carried from F103 R5 through the whole of F104):
  `TestAutoBuildBehavior::test_auto_build_runs_by_default` in
  `tests/ui_server/test_dashboard_contract.py` pops `REMEDY_UI_NO_AUTO_BUILD`
  and runs a real `npm install` + `npm run build` in whatever checkout it runs
  in, refreshing `apps/ui/dist` mtimes mid-suite. That costs every integration
  gate six or seven phantom base-only failures through the mtime comparison in
  `_frontend_is_stale()`. Carried into F105 unchanged: it is not this feature's
  code either, AGENTS.md Scope Control bars the "while I'm here" edit, and it
  stays routed to the F252 flake-debt class, to be attributed by controlled
  evidence at the integration gate rather than chased. OPEN.

## Steps

- R1: claim F105 `[~]` under Rule A5, sweep both F104 closure candidates into
  docs/agents/planner_reviewer_prompt.md (§4.4 `Landed:` versus `Done:`, §4.13
  the terminating convention), empty `.agent/candidates.md`, and reset the
  `.agent/` state to F105. No `packages/`, `apps/`, `tests/` or `README.md`
  byte changed.
- Reviewer gate on R1 (2026-08-09): PASS. Range `cfda4245..6b74d7c4` read as a real
  diff — nine paths, all of them the ones the block named; nothing under
  `packages/`, `apps/`, `tests/`, no `README.md`, no `ROADMAP.md`. Pairs A, B and C
  applied byte for byte; the four full-file rewrites match their authored text.
  `docs/roadmap/STATUS.md` differs from main by exactly one line, the F105 claim.
  Gates re-run by the reviewer from the repo root with real exit codes:
  `tests/docs/` 294 passed, the `.agent` contract tests 4 passed, resource safety
  21 passed, the canary 42 passed, `remedy integrity check --json` `"passed": true`
  over 5 checks, `.agent/candidates.md` holding `**No open candidates.**` exactly
  once, working tree clean, HEAD equal to origin.
- R2: T001 — `packages/orchestration/prompt_segments.py` with the rank scale,
  the registry, `compose_prompt_segments`, the segment manifest and the
  conventions token cap, pinned by 22 tests. No builder migrated, no prompt
  content changed.
- Reviewer gate on R2 (2026-08-09): PASS. Range `6b74d7c4..4d01a40a` read as a real
  diff — six files, exactly the change set the block named. Gates re-run by the
  reviewer: the new suite 22 passed, `test_token_economy.py` 37 passed,
  `tests/docs/` 294 passed, the canary 42 passed, integrity 5 of 5, tree clean,
  HEAD equal to origin. THREE independent mutation red-proofs, run in a disposable
  worktree at 4d01a40a that was removed and pruned before this verdict: dropping
  the rank from the sort key turns 3 tests RED, giving the delimiter an injected
  marker turns 5 RED, and disabling the token-cap check turns 1 RED. The guards
  are load bearing. `LAST_REVIEWED_SHA` advances 6b74d7c4 -> 4d01a40a.
