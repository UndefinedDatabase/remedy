# Plan — F086 Release capability

Branch: feature/f086-release-capability, pushed and unmerged, cut from `main` at
76661dc1. No pull request exists: this feature is mid-flight and its PR belongs to
its closure round. `.agent/live_review.md` is the source of truth for the open set,
for the next free finding id and for the round map; this file repeats none of them.

## Goal
Remedy ships like a normal tool: `pip install` yields the `remedy` CLI with the
UI assets bundled, `remedy --version` reports version and build info, and a
release is gated by CI plus a semver and changelog discipline. DONE when a wheel
built from a clean checkout installs into a fresh virtualenv where the golden
path and the UI serve work, the version command matches the tag, and a release
with a missing changelog entry is refused by the gate.

## Current Step
R20: write the install smoke DECISION F086 D4 rules — `tests/test_install_smoke.py`,
one module that self-skips unless `REMEDY_INSTALL_SMOKE` is set — and record R19's
verdict plus R-0586, the finding R19 produced against the reviewer.

## Next Steps
1. R21 promotes R-0586's rule into the §3 pre-emission checklist, item 20, where a
   rule has to live to bind the next block, and records R20's verdict.
2. Then the smoke's wall-clock is MEASURED on a host that can run it, and only
   then is a CI stage chosen to opt in — the `smoke` stage carries a 300 s budget
   that AGENTS.md forbids raising by hand.
3. Then the integration gate (docs/agents/integration_gate.md) and closure. The
   packaging ist-doc is written at closure, when the built state stops moving.
4. THE RELEASE WORKFLOW HAS NEVER BEEN RUN and NO INSTALL HAS EVER BEEN PROVEN;
   no round of this workflow can do either. Both are human actions.

## Risks
- The install smoke needs network, a venv interpreter and minutes. MEASURED at
  R17: this session's permission layer refuses to execute an interpreter under
  `.remedy-wt/`, so a self-drive round can write that smoke but cannot run it.
- A build tool's file selection depends on WHERE the tree is: hatchling drops
  every VCS exclusion when the build root is gitignore-matched, so any packaging
  probe uses a worktree OUTSIDE this repository (finding R-0574).
- Ruff is RED repo-wide at 26 pre-existing errors and is NOT a gate; a round
  touching Python gates ruff scoped to the files it touches, by multiset.
