# Plan — F085 Sandbox hardening (stage 1)

Branch: feature/f085-sandbox-hardening, cut from origin/main at a5a70621 after
the F083 closure PR #202 and the amendment PR #203 merged.
`.agent/live_review.md` is the source of truth for the open set, for the next
free finding id and for the round map; this file repeats none of them.

## Goal
Builder-spawned commands stop relying on prompted discipline: every builder,
test and DoD subprocess gets POSIX resource limits, a per-command wall timeout,
output-size caps, a cwd pinned inside the worktree, an environment allowlist and
a default-deny network posture — with a document that says EXACTLY what stage 1
does and does not prevent. DONE when the limits provably kill a runaway fixture
(cpu, memory, oversized output, endless sleep) and classify it `resource_limit`
with the tripped limit named, an off-scope write attempt fails, well-behaved
commands behave identically under the guard, a secret-like parent env var never
reaches a child, and the limitations document exists and is linked from the
README.

## Current Step
R52, this round: the `dod-app` seam alone, in `packages/orchestration/exec_guard.py`. It takes no
wall timeout and no output cap — both are parent-side, and its caller owns its own deadline and
writes the app's output to a file. One test ships with it. Its caller migrates at R53, so the
module's PARTIAL COVERAGE note is untouched here and stays true. The R51 PASS is recorded in the
same round, with finding R-0554.

## Next Steps
1. T002c — migrate `_run_app_once` in `packages/orchestration/dod_runners.py` onto that seam,
   taking the CHILD half alone through `plan_child_spawn`, and rewrite the `exec_guard` coverage
   note in the same round, because only the call site's move makes that note false.
2. T002d — the runtime sites under DECISION F085 D8: `runtime-server` takes no wall timeout and
   `runtime-build` keeps the one it already has. That round also extracts the guard-result
   translation the `test` and `dod-process` seams each carry, once three uses show its shape.
3. T003 — network posture, the limitations document, its README link. That document states what
   the CHILD-half migrations do NOT bound: an app log written to a file takes no guard output cap.
   Then the integration gate, then closure.

## Risks
- An allowlist bounds what the PARENT hands over, never what the child's runtime
  adds back: a CPython child sets `LC_CTYPE` itself under PEP 538. T003's
  limitations document must say so rather than claim a sealed environment.
- A stream still blocked at the grace deadline leaks one pipe read end and one
  daemon thread. Closing an fd under a blocked reader risks that thread reading
  a recycled fd after a later `open()`, so the leak is the cheaper wrong.
