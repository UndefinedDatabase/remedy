# Remedy Architecture

## What Remedy Is

Remedy is a modular orchestration kernel. It coordinates tasks, manages artifacts, and enforces acceptance criteria. It does not implement intelligence itself — it delegates to providers.

Remedy is designed to be embedded as a library inside a larger system. It does not own the process, the event loop, or the configuration system. A host application wires the providers and runs Remedy as a module.

## Core Principles

### Strict Core / Provider Separation

The `packages/core` and `packages/contracts` packages have **no external dependencies**. They define models and interfaces only. All integrations (LLMs, runtimes, memory systems) live in `packages/providers/` and are wired in at the application layer.

```
core/contracts  ←  no external deps; models + interfaces only
       ↑
orchestration   ←  depends on contracts only
       ↑
memory/runtimes ←  provider-agnostic internal layers (see below)
       ↑
providers       ←  concrete adapters; implement contracts; depend on external systems
       ↑
apps            ←  wire everything together
```

### Package Roles

**`packages/memory/`** — Provider-agnostic memory management layer. Implements caching, indexing, and query logic on top of whatever `MemoryGateway` implementation is active. It does not depend on any specific storage backend. MemPalace or any other system plugs in via the gateway interface.

**`packages/runtimes/`** — Provider-agnostic runtime abstraction layer. Handles command scheduling, timeout enforcement, and output capture. The concrete execution environment (local shell, Docker, remote sandbox) is supplied by a `RuntimeProvider` adapter. This layer does not know whether it is running locally or in a container.

**`packages/providers/mempalace/`** — Concrete adapter: implements `MemoryGateway` backed by MemPalace. This is the only package that knows about MemPalace internals. Replace this adapter to swap the memory backend without touching `packages/memory/` or orchestration.

**`packages/providers/docker_runtime/`** — Concrete adapter: implements `RuntimeProvider` backed by Docker. This is the only package that knows about Docker. Replace this adapter to swap the execution environment without touching `packages/runtimes/` or orchestration.

### Artifact-Driven Workflow

Work is expressed as `Job → Task → Artifact`, not as prompt strings. Artifacts are explicit, typed outputs with provenance (which task produced them). Workflows are not driven by raw prompts.

### Memory Gateway

All memory access goes through the `MemoryGateway` interface. No component reaches into a memory system directly. This makes the memory backend replaceable without touching orchestration logic.

### Composability

Every layer is replaceable:
- Swap the LLM provider without changing orchestration.
- Swap the runtime (local shell, Docker, remote) without changing task logic.
- Swap the memory backend without changing the core.

### No Monolith

Remedy must remain usable as a library inside a larger system. It does not own the process, the event loop, or the configuration system. It provides primitives that a host application composes.
